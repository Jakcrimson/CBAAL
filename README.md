  CONSENSUS-BASED AUCTION ALGORITHM LIBRARY
            by Pierre LAGUE

# CBAAL - Consensus Based Auction Algorithm Library

## Overview

CBAAL is a library developed as part of my end-of-year assignment for my first-year master's degree. It focuses on implementing consensus-based auction algorithms (CBAA) and consensus-based bundle algorithm (CBBA) primarily for dynamic load balancing problems. The algorithms implemented in this library are inspired by the publication of Choi et al., which introduced these innovative approaches to solving load balancing challenges in dynamix environments. 📚💼

## Features

- Implementation of CBAA and CBBA algorithms.
- Designed for dynamic load balancing scenarios.
- Provides a framework for simulating load balancing strategies over various network topologies.
- Well-documented codebase for easy understanding and modification. 🛠️📝

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CBAAL.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the cloned directory:
   ```
   cd CBAAL
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

After a simulation a gif will be saved showing you the process of the task assignement :
